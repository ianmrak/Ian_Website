  <!-- <h2>Who am I?</h2> -->
  <!-- <p class="aboutme">Hi! My name's Ian Mrak. I'm 26 years old and in the final stages of completing my MFA in 3D Character Animation.</p>
  <p class="aboutme">I grew up on a horse farm outside of Little Rock, Arkansas. When I wasn't outside I was engrossed in any digital medium I could get my hands on because it was sometimes difficult making the drive into town to see friends. My grade school had a quality art program and was able to provide digital art software which sparked my initial interest. I also had several friends who were interested in learning programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator which helped further my curiosity about graphic art.</p>
  <p class="aboutme">Despite this, my focus in college ended up being Biology with the intent on moving on to medical school. Both my parents worked in the scientific field and I enjoyed learning. Thus I graduated in 2011 with a B.S. in Biology from the University of Arkansas. However, during the final stages on my undergrad I was having difficulty imagining myself working in the medical field and after repeated discussions from friends and family, decided to change direction.</p>
  <p class="aboutme">I then packed up and moved to San Francisco where I spent a year pursuing an MFA in Game Design at the Academy of Art University. I fell in love with Maya and especially enjoyed creating environments. My decision to change tracks was largely influenced by an environment modeling class I took that focused heavily on Maya and ZBrush. I came to realized my preference to design over game mechanics in my classes, switch to the Animation program and haven't looked back!</p> -->
