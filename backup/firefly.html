<h2>Project Abstract:</h2>
  <p>
  I've always loved the fantasy genre. It's so open to colorful stories and
  characters. For my animation thesis, I wanted to create a heart-warming and
  cute story of a youthful spirit's departure from tradition. The story is a
  sort of folklore-inspired origin story for why the moon shines at night.
  We follow a young spirit as he leaves his dark world behind and discovers
  what's just out of sight.
  </p>
<h2>Project Proposal:</h2>
  <p>
  My goal is to challenge my animating skills and design a quality film that
  is entertaining with an appealing color palette. I'm aiming for roughly two
  minutes and thirty seconds for time. I intend to create a memorable world by
  using proper lighting, music, and characters. The film will have no dialogue
  so body language and music timing will be paramount. The color scheme will be
  a mixture of pale and saturated shaders to help establish the atmosphere of
  each scene. The mood will feel like a child's storybook.

 <h2>Story Details:</h2>
  <p>
  Our story begins with a gradual descent into a dark forest. Deep within the
  woods, a circular object is found hovering in a glade. Suddenly, a lantern
  swoops by and activates the orb, lighting the area around it. A troupe of
  spirits is then revealed making their way down a well-travelled path. The
  procession lights their way by activating magical orbs with their staffs.
  A small, wide-eyed youth starkly contrasts the four dutiful adults. He flits
  around behind their orderly gate and is clearly interested in the orbs.
  His curiosity finally gets the better of him and he tries to touch an orb with
  his lantern. He is quickly stopped and given a disapproving stare from
  one of the adults.
  </p>
  <p>
  The youth gives a sigh of boredom and stares at moon through a break in the
  trees. He continues to stare as he walks past one of the lit orbs. Suddenly,
  the youth comes to a realization and quickly looks at the orb and then the
  moon. He stops the adults and excitedly points his lantern at the moon. The
  adults, after realizing his intentions, exchange a mix of humor and annoyance
  before continuing on. The child's excitement is replaced by anger at their
  disregard and he leaves the group behind. He runs up to the base of the tree
  where we transition to the treetops right as he pops up
  from the leaves.
  </p>
  <p>
  The spirit hops onto a protruding branch and promptly wiggles his lantern at
  the moon. Nothing happens. This does nothing but feed the spirit's
  determination to prove the adults wrong. The scene is cut to black in the
  middle of a powerful swing of his lantern. Back in the forest, the adults are
  marching along when the forest is shaken by a blinding explosion. They recover
  to see the dark forest well lit all around them. Their preoccupation with the
  scene above causes them to miss the youth descend from a nearby tree. Only
  when he haughtily walks by them to they put two and two together. The camera
  pans up from the troupe to finally reveal a fully lit moon in the night sky.
